“Module 3 — Feasibility & Guardrails” (the 8 if/else checks).

1. Closed Venue

If: A museum, park, or attraction is likely closed on that day or time.

Then: Swap it for a similar nearby option (ideally same type: museum → museum, park → park).

2. Over-Budget Meal

If: A planned meal clearly exceeds the user’s stated budget style.

Then: Replace it with a cheaper restaurant of similar cuisine or vibe.

3. Too Much Travel

If: Travel between two activities is more than ~25 minutes or ~5 km.

Then: Prefer a closer alternative, or insert a short transit segment and simplify the schedule.

4. Weather Swap

If: The season or likely weather suggests rain, cold, or extreme heat for a mostly outdoor plan.

Then: Ensure at least one indoor activity is added, and replace fragile outdoor items where needed.

5. Time Overrun

If: The total planned time for the day doesn’t reasonably fit into normal waking hours.

Then: Shorten or drop the least important stop, tighten meal durations, or group nearby items.

6. Mobility Needs

If: The user mentions mobility limits or prefers minimal walking.

Then: Choose step-free, short-walk options, avoid steep areas, and include rest breaks when possible.

7. Dietary Needs

If: The user has dietary requirements (e.g., vegan, halal, allergies).

Then: Ensure all meals respect those constraints, and swap any conflicting restaurant suggestions.

8. Bookings & Tickets

If: An activity usually needs tickets or reservations.
